# AnalyticaX

**AnalyticaX** is a data science project analyzing cybersecurity attack datasets.  
It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree) to predict attack types.

## Project Structure
- `cybersecurity_attacks.csv` – Dataset used for analysis  
- Jupyter Notebooks – Step-by-step exploration, preprocessing, and model training  

## Features
- Handles missing values and outliers  
- Creates derived features from timestamps, ports, and IP addresses  
- Implements ML pipelines for classification  
- Visualizes target distribution and feature importance  

## Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, xgboost, imbalanced-learn  

## Usage
1. Open the folder in Jupyter Notebook or VSCode.  
2. Run notebooks step-by-step to reproduce data preprocessing and model results.
